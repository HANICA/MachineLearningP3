# MachineLearningP3
Python 3 Machine Learning Libraries for Stanford MOOC on Machine Learning

Original sources: https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git

Apparently there are some issues with the original code, especially if one desires to use Python3
Not using Python 3 without setting up virtual environments causes other issues (e.g. Python 2 being unable to find some modules that were not installed 'cause pip thought there were already available)
